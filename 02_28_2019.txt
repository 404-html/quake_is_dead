<h1>Half-assed games never out of beta</h1>
<p>There have been no recent updates because I have not been playing video games, I'm finished playing low quality games that skimp on performance, matchmaking, and netcode. While graphics are getting better with new releases, the bugs and performance have gotten worse. Balance is terrible in every game because of the existence of a meta. While having classes and "champions" are supposed to enable different playstyles while living out your fantasy as some badass or sexy persona, overpowered classes/champions and balance decisions that are based off of the games of rock-paper-scissors and tic-tac-toe are destroying this diversity. There's only one correct way to play, only 1 correct weapon, 1 correct champion, 1 correct team composition or you are throwing the game. This is no longer fun. Every multiplayer game is now just an IQ puzzle. Aiming is no longer a factor, since movement is too slow, hitboxes are too large, hitscan with lag compensation exists, projectiles are too large, too fast, and too spammable. Every game today now has the movement of Halo with the weapon lethality of Counter Strike, the worst of both worlds. Why? Because support for console players requires this level of casualization. I cannot believe I was duped into paying for skins in games that are functionally broken, so many new releases are monetizing unfinished buggy games.</p>
<p>Apex Legends is the latest of this trend, youtube uploader <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP7QY6L5pvmm0-stL-pNFrw">Battle(non)sense</a> did a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PfFPW9a90w">netcode review of Apex Legends</a>. His findings show two serious problems with that game's netcode: the rate of packets sent to clients is not constant, it flucuates between 20 and 60. Battle(non)sense was able to find out why this was the case and it was because Apex Legends servers are sending too much data per server tick, resulting in multiple packets being sent as the first packet overflows. The other problem is that two players playing on the same server with the same ping (20ms in his experiment) will receive enemy gunfire and enemy movement updates with a delay of up to 250ms. Compare this with CS:GO's network delays that reach up to 65ms. I would imagine that people can still enjoy battle royale games with terrible netcode since combat is rare in those types of games. But I cannot stand bad netcode anymore and I cannot play the trending luck based battle royale modes.</p>
<p>I tried to enjoy Realm Royale but I get tired of the non-combat combat scenarios, what I mean is peek and burst on right hand side tactics that are the only way to fight in games like this. People have to play this way since dodging is impossible and missing is impossible too, it all comes down to abusing peeker's advantage with the correct ping which can be increased with the proper tools. Raw muscle memory is negligible to your victory, only having good luck and making the correct rock-paper-scissors move will ensure victory and this goes against what I think is fun for the players and entertaining to the viewers. I want real PvP combat but games like this encourage looting and hiding more than actual combat. Games with one shot kill weapons and movement slower than a Prius in a Starbuck's drive thru encourage camping more than combat. There are no more games that can give me that ultra instinct rush that I crave, now it's all about positioning and hugging walls.</p>
