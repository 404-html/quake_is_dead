			<h1>Prelude</h1>
			<p>There is a long lost spirit of first-person shooters that have been forgotten, even I myself have forgotten. Perhaps this spirit was never consciously known, but it defined the roots of the FPS genre and it was imbued in the depths of almost every programmer's soul. Through the atmosphere of the games created through this spirit rose the spectacles of true competition and the clear distinction between the amatuers and the legends. Violence to the most beautiful degree blossomed as enemies danced on the battlefield through their mind games. Artificial progression systems, which reward players based on their time and money spent rather than their true progression in skill, did not exist and were not necessary. The feeling of accomplishment was naturally felt when the player improved over and against other players without the need of the game telling them that they were getting better. In fact, none of the artificial incentives existed to keep players in the game; this includes: daily login rewards, battle passes, quests, loot boxes, champion/weapon unlocks, etc.</p>
			<p>Games back then were simply conduits for demonstrating the natural diversity of skill between humans, with no other motive or effect other than separating the best individual players from the worst individual players. Even the weak players, if they had the will for it, were willing to keep playing to improve themselves without the need for a participation trophy. At the end of the day, the greatest satisfaction of the game was the feeling of self-improvement, and not just the feeling, but the realization of it and the reinforcement of that realization when one is put to the test.</p>
			<p>Like classic games such as Chess, a balanced multiplayer game that rewards skill rather than effort has the respect of everyone, both dedicated veteran players and mere spectators alike. Chess does not attempt to keep players when it knows that it itself is not meant for everyone. It has no profit motive to seduce the non-competitive, non-capable players. It does not attempt to force players into teams and require that great players make up for dead weight on their team in order to share the satisfaction of victory to those who do not deserve it. Chess does not give certain players special pieces that allow them to make moves that other players cannot perform without paying a fee. Chess does not have glitches or crashes, the board does not randomly self-destruct on it's own. Chess is a finished game, there are no balance updates and no new content that changes the rules of the game: no new pieces get introduced, the board has always been the same, there is nothing more to add to the game because it is perfect and balanced.</p>
			<p>I yearn for the day when the FPS genre takes up the mantle to impose it's own vision on the players whom it deems of worthy material to shape something great out of. I dream of a game that is not simply for the entertainment of it's player or spectators, such entertainment would be a side-effect when the players themselves are transformed and unleashed to demonstrate powers they never even knew they had. A game that has no vision, no direction, no will other than to siphon wealth from their players' pockets will do whatever it takes to keep everyone happy, at the cost of lowering the bar and taming and crucifying the greatest players.</p>
			<p>As far as I can see, every FPS out there has been infected with the ideals of the inferior multiplayer genres such as the MMORPG, a genre meant for the most base and slavish players who have nothing to their names other than the virtues of the cattle which benefits the farmer (developer) with milk (time) and beef (money). One can see this starting from the introduction of "classes" within the FPS, each class having a particular weapon, a particular health pool and movement speed, and eventually a particular set of abilities. As the number of classes grow, so do the complexities of the abilities and the effort it takes to balance all of these. The obsession for what is new prompts the developers to create more classes, more weapons, more abilities. As they run out of ideas, they introduce more and more unfair mechanics such as: wallhacks, autoaim, stuns, abilities that destroy full health enemies in one shot. As the game changes due to these game-changing updates, older players are driven away because the game they once knew has now left them; some still play for nostalgic purposes or perhaps because they already invested so much time and money and they don't want to have their in-game cosmetics or pay-to-win weapons go to waste for not being used. In the end, these FPS games that are infected with MMORPG elements become the same as MMORPGs: games that are meaningless grinds that at bottom have no purpose. Gambling is more productive and less expensive than playing these types of games. The innovative Koreans are wise enough to realize this and have already enacted laws to put these criminals in their place. It is sad that laws are required for this because people are not smart enough to realize that they are being scammed, and not just individual players but entire organizations that sponser players in esport tournaments only to slowly see the game die due to selfish mis-management and ultimately a conscious denial of the unconscious instincts that give us real pleasure when our body and spirit rise beyond our moral limits.</p>
			<h1>Battle Royale</h1>
			<p>As of today's writing, "battle royale" is the trendiest sub-genre of the FPS. This is by far the most audacious attempt to herd as many players together like cattle onto a single server in order to save money. Battle Royale has an innovative new way to take away skill from the first-person shooter, by making it into a third-person shooter so that players can peek around corners without exposing their bodies. But the most obvious RPG element injected into this sub-genre is the most anti-skill luck based component: looting. Every battle royal game is about 80% running around looting chests lying around the map while real combat remains rare. Lucky people, regardless of skill, will be more likely to acquire the best loot which is so good that it allows them to kill the most skillful players within the most unbalanced battle royale games. And who is to say that these battle royale games do not grant more luck to the less skilled players to keep them from uninstalling the game in frustration of realizing how unskilled they are? We may never know because they do not make their games open-source because everyone knows that open-source software does not make money. Richard Stallman is a communist idiot. Not even modern china believes in communism anymore.</p>
			<p>Battle Royale is also another money saving attempt to prevent from hiring artists to create multiple maps. In battle royale, there is only one big map that everyone plays over and over again. Even within this big map, the scenery and houses get repeated. The great innovation of battle royale is the downsizing in quantity and quality of everything while giving players the illusion that they are getting more.</p>
			<p>The one good thing that came out of battle royale is the weapon balance. Because the the map is so big, everyone knows that hitscan weapons will always be superior to projectile-based weapons. Therefore, all weapons are made into projectile-based weapons including the snipers. Lag compensation techniques specific to hitscan weapons are now no longer required, which means it's specific side effects such as getting hit behind walls are now less common or non-existant in battle royale games. It took long enough for this simple feature to make snipers balanced. For many years, probably decades, snipers have always been overpowered. Their historically high damage, high accuracy, and instant hit registration made them so powerful that they sometimes were used in preference over shotguns at close range. Many things were done to make snipers more balanced over the years: less damage, a scope, a charge up time, inaccuracy with movement, high reload time. None of these things seemed to work until battle royale decided to just make it into a projectile-based weapon with projectile drop. This is a step in the right direction.</p>
			<p>Battle Royale, however, is extremely boring for me. I find it frustrating to run around a map mindlessly collecting items for 15 minutes without encountering any enemies, then unexpectedly dying to an enemy who has better items than me and not being able to respawn. Every specific battle royale game makes this worse with their own specific short comings. PUBG's low ttk and complex UI makes it not worth the pay to play price. Fortnite's building mechanic makes all battles into a "who can spam walls and build to high ground faster" rather than an actual battle. Realm Royale's prevalance of NPCs makes the game completely pointless to play; Forges are also worthless when so many loot goblins and airship drops give you rare items for free.</p>
			<p>Even if you currently enjoy the battle royale genre, it will only get worse when more battle royale games get released that attempt to have classes and abilities in them. Before you know it, the standard procedure will be to lock specific classes behind a grind or pay wall; thus effectively making it pay to win. No I do not care that you can grind for it for free, if I have to grind for a month to get something for free, then it's pay to win for all practical purposes because time is money.</p>
			<p>Battle Royale is the most RNG based sub-genre of shooters in existence now. I abhor all RNG components. If it were up to me, I would never design a video game that invokes <tt>rand()</tt>, not even once: not for abilities (such as RNG critical damage), not for loot boxes on the map (because there will be none), not for weapon spread (shotguns will instead have a consistent geometric pattern that can be replicated on clients), not even for cosmetic or aesthetic effects.</p>
