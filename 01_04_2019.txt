<h1>The failed indie attempts to revive arena shooters</h1>
<p>These little <q>early access</q>/<q>open beta</q> games come and go. Some of them are cash cows, some are business and marketing failures, others are spiritual debasements of the holy genre.</p>
<p>I want to start with <i>Toxikk</i>. It's a beautiful looking game, probably the best graphics I've seen in an FPS; the performance does not suffer at all. There's a level of respect I have to the indie developers of this game even though I do not like the way the game plays. That's right, I do not like the gameplay of Toxikk. The double-strafe movement mechanic, similar to the passive movement ability of Clutch from QC, does not feel fluid, it feels clunky to me. Maybe some people like it, but it feels like a chore to be double tapping WASD all the time. I honestly was never a fan of Unreal Tournament style movement. There are also some inconsistencies with how it's advertised as a classic arena shooter that takes FPS <q>back to it's roots</q> versus how loyal it is to this advertising point when one actually plays the game.</p>
<p>Their debut trailer lists the following while showing gameplay footage: no classes, no levelling, no regenerating health, no cover systems, no iron sight aiming, no reload, ...no bullshit; then immediately after that last item they show what looks like a Warthog vehicle from Halo and another vehicle that looks like a Ghost vehicle from Halo, Later on I discover that this Ghost is actually named <q>Banshee</q> in the game. Like all vehicles in FPS, they can run people over and are equipped with super powerful weapons.</p>
<p>Vehicles are not something that I look for in a serious and balanced FPS that's supposed to be competitive. They can be a fun idea in extremely casual play, but they are an unfair mechanic. Nobody ever gets killed by a vehicle and thinks <q>Wow, that guy really outplayed me. Props to him.</q>. No, our first reaction is <q>Bullshit, vehicles are cheap and OP.</q>. As another kinky feature for this game, all Toxikk players have the ability to go into stealth and spawn hover bikes. Why? For no reason but to be <q>innovative</q>, but innovation is not a virtue when you are trying to revive classic FPS gameplay.</p>
<p>This may have changed since the last time I played it, but the Toxikk weapon respawn time was really aggravating: it was 15 seconds; so most of the time everybody is running around with the starting pistol while one guy has all the weapons. Having 15 second weapon respawns really slows down the game, it does not do justice to what's supposed to be a fast-paced arena shooter. Even the 5 second weapon respawn in Quake 3 was too long for me, many community servers in Quake 3 and Quake Live decided to mod it to 1 second. The weapon spawns are bad enough, but look at the 60 second respawn times for their megahealth, medium armor, and heavy armor!</p>
<p>Let's look at Reflex now. This game is definitely better than Toxikk gameplay wise, and even graphics wise for the reasons that everything in Reflex is easily distinguishable. Unlike Toxikk, where you cannot distinguish between health and ammo pickups because they both look like tiny red boxes, in Reflex the graphics look like r_lodbias 2 in Quake. All textures are smooth and minimal so you can actually see what you're aiming at and not be distracted by other unnecessary animations on the map. The UI customizations are top notch, many ways to change your crosshairs. This game replicates all the standard Quake 3 weapons, they have a: shotgun, grenade launcher, lightning gun, rocket launcher, railgun, and plasma gun. The names for some of these weapons are different, but they function the same. In early stages of development, all of these weapons were underpowered. The shotgun used to deal a maximum of 60 damage, the lightning gun used to deal 5 damage per tick for a total of 100 DPS, the railgun used to deal 75 damage and the plasma gun used to deal 12 damage for a total of 120 DPS. You would often run out of ammo before you could kill anything and it doesn't help that the movement in this game is CPMA on steriods so dying was pretty impossible. They have since changed these weapon damages to more sensible values, I would play this game more often if there were any players at all.</p>
<p>They decided to put a price tag on this game, you have to pay $10 to play. As of today's writing, I see that the player count reached it's highest of 28 in the last 6 months. It's safe to say the game is dead and it doesn't help that there's no offline play with bots and almost every populated server is password protected. How does one get into a game on Reflex? Do I have to join secret discord or irc channels and network so I can get into a pickup game? The game feels very unwelcome to new players.</p>
<p>I may try out ratz instagib, but steamcharts says there are less than 40 people on average playing this in the past 6 months. Some other older games worthy of mention is Xonotic, Openarena, Warsow, Nexuiz. All of them are more or less dead, maybe Xonotic and Openarena have a small devoted community but even they are so small that they have to organize pickup games for anything to happen.</p>
