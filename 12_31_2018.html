			<p>A blog on the state of multiplayer first-person shooters.</p>

			<h1>Pessimism for all FPS</h1>
			<p>I uninstalled Paladins. I still recommend the game to other people, but not for myself at this point because I know that what I want for myself from an FPS is fundamentally different from what most people want or are comfortable with.</p>
			<p>The sheer deciding factor for victory, the most important element that I would prefer to be required and developed by all players is individual skill. This is why, at bottom, I cannot play team based games without taking periodic vacations of solitude from them lest I lose my sanity for being dragged down by the most mediocre of players or being yelled at by the resentful controls freaks who think they know the best way to play the game. But the most frustrating aspect of all team based shooters for me is the fact that squads/parties/groups will always have higher winrates against solo players and we have yet to see a matchmaking algorithm offset this phenomenon in my 2 decades of playing multiplayer shooters. I do not care that the latest update of Paladins is weaning off burst meta by removing cauterize from loadouts and introducing more self-healing cards. I do not care anymore for the newest prettiest cosmetics. The existing bugs do not bother me and the bugs they are fixing does not make me excited, bug fixing is to be expected and it's a requirement: it is not something to be happy about like one is getting a treat or reward from it. The one thing that has never changed about Paladins for me is the parties giving really one-sided games against solo players. Whether the fault is matchmaking or the game allowing parties to go against solo players makes no difference, the end result is bad games.</p>
			<p>If Overwatch wasn't fundamentally flawed at it's core from a game balancing perspective, I would migrate over to it for it's polish, performance, backfill feature, and the "avoid as teammate" option. But Overwatch was always a horrible game to me from it's inception, among it's fatal errors include the 0.3 second TTK, the stuns, and the lack of movement deceleration during strafe spamming.</p>
			<p>Even at it's historically worst stage in it's development (Patch OB 64), Paladins was still a better game than Overwatch. Player movement in Paladins has always been trackable in aiming, the TTK has always been lower than Overwatch's TTK (even during the era of "burst meta" in Paladins), players have always had more choices to define their playstyle in Paladins, the Paladins meta has always changed faster and has never been more strict than the Overwatch meta. The core design of Paladins is superior than Overwatch, however the polish and performance of Overwatch has always been better.</p>
			<p>I have however, come to hate both of these games as well as all games like them because of the gaming industry's shift from individual performance to team performance. Quake is dead and deathmatch is dead. Most players need to be carried in a team to keep playing lest they uninstall in frustration which results in lost profits for the game company. The theory is that the talents of the best players can spread and uplift the worst players; in practice, however, the misery resulting from the lack of skill of the basest and most numerous players spreads to all players. The best players are now effectively the slaves of the worst players for this reason. Esports cannot blossom if this emphasis on keeping all players, even the most mediocre ones, guides every game balancing and matchmaking decision. A great game will allow the best players to reveal and exercise their power as a spectacle for all to see. Why do the developers insist on pruning all skill-based mechanics in favor of easy-to-use and downright unfair mechanics? It is ridiculous how we have built-in wall-hacking and auto-aim in what are supposed to be competitive first person shooters today.</p>
			<p>Quake Champions is not our savior in the midst of the current plague of the industry; instead, QC has been infected by the same RPG sentiments. Quake used to be the most balanced game: all players are equal, all players spawn with equal health and equal weapons, there are no loadouts and no special class-specific abilities, all weapons required aiming, even the graphics were superior for the reason that visual clutter and frame-drops were non-existant. The Quake of today, branded as "Quake Champions", instead has incorporated champions, loadouts, unequal health and armor pools, unequal hitboxes, visual clutter, poor performance, poor netcode, a battlepass, and pay to win walls with most champions being locked unless you grind for years. Even if you grind for 3 months for one additional champion, if you do not grind fast enough, you can never be too sure if the next update will reset everyone's accounts and take away all your in-game currency without warning. This is why I do not spend any money on that game. The QC devs are crooks and should be sued for the thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours consumers have collectively spent and lost on that game for nothing in return.</p>
			<p>"Quake Champions" is to "Quake" as what "The Last Airbender" movie is to "Avatar: The Last Airbender": a hellspawn. A hideous creature we all wish was aborted. Something we don't even talk about because we can't even muster enough energy to denounce it's existence enough. We pretend it doesn't exist because we risk a spiritual curse on ourselves for even allowing it attention into our lives, it's the unspoken evil, it's name is forbidden. You can already see the physical effects that QC has had on our beloved saint and legendary warrior: Rapha. See how QC has accelerated his aging. Look into his eyes and see pain and emptiness.</p>
			<h1>Why matchmaking is a religion for fools</h1>
			<p>Back in the day, one could launch a game, go to the server browser, pick their favorite server and jump into a game right away. You could also leave whenever you want and nobody would care, either because the game mode was free-for-all or because the players were civilized enough to voluntarily switch to spectator mode to balance the teams or because an existing spectator could take your place after you leave. People had the capacity to self-govern themselves.</p>
			<p>Today, one has to wait for 2 minutes, sometimes 5, sometimes 10, sometimes 20 minutes in the matchmaking queue before joining a game. Even after waiting for so long, the match ends up being unbalanced and either unwinnable or unloseable for one side. The rush that one wants to get from the action of a game is spoiled by high waiting times. Even after you finish a match, you must wait for the stupid animations that play out showing you how far you've "progressed" in their artificial progression system or battle pass.</p>
			<p>You often hear people say that a perfect matchmaking system guarantees a "50% winrate" for everyone. However, I've seen plenty of matchmaking systems give people roughly 50% winrates by allowing them to win 10 games in a row by placing them against the worst players, followed by forcing them to lose 10 games in a row by placing them against the best players. When one talks about 50% winrate, it must be qualified: is the 50% chance of winning already decided for one team before the match has even started or is it constantly developing throughout the entire match so that every match ends up being a close and intersting match? In the former case, this is called a "forced 50% winrate" and it has nothing to do with your skill level: it has all to do with equalizing the wins and losses for everyone so that nobody feels like a loser because everyone is a winner 50% of the time, everyone gets a participation trophy. In practice, these types of matchmaking systems make everyone feel like a loser. Why should I get better at this game if matchmaking will punish me for it by making my teammates more and more incompetant?</p>
			<p>A 50% winrate, either in the good sense of very close games or the bad sense of forced losses, is impossible anyways because of many factors:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Players can form into groups, often times full squads so that they become one unit; matchmaking cannot sort them individually into separate teams for the sake of balance, instead matchmaking must find and assemble other players who match the combined skill of the full squad. This is impossible if there are no available players currently in the matchmaking queue that can fulfill this requirement.</li>
				<li>Players can create "smurf accounts": they can create a new account on the game thus effectively resetting their MMR.</li>
				<li>In a hero shooter, the player chooses a hero that they are not skilled with after matchmaking has already assembled the teams.</li>
				<li>Most players do not perform consistently, by sheer luck they may have their good days or their bad days. Their skill is not constant, it fluctuates depending on many external factors that the game cannot measure.</li>
				<li>Many matchmaking systems fail to take into account individual skill, which is possibly represented by more than just a single integer, and instead opt to take a variation of the ELO system, a system designed for the 1v1 game of Chess that ranks players by their wins/losses, and apply it to players in a complex multiplayer team-based game.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The 50% winrate, actualized as forced losses, is the only 50% winrate that has the possibility of being attained for one simple reason: The skill variation of all humans for any game does not resemble a rectangle. It is not the case that for every skill level, there are an equal number of players. There are two possible general cases: the skill variations of the player base resembles a diamond or the the skill variations of the player base resembles a pyramid. In the diamond scheme: you have a few players who are the most skilled, a few players who are the least skilled, and the majority of players who have medium skill. In the pyramid scheme: you have a few players who are the most skilled and as the skill decreases along the model, the number of players representing that skill level increases. Do not forget the fact that at any time in any region of the world, only a subset of the players of either of these models are available to play against each other thus we have no way of knowing what the effective model will look like in practice within a real world context.</p>
			<p>Let me reveal to you the perfect matchmaking algorithm that guarantees a 50% winrate: complete randomness. Just take random players who are online and within reasonable latency distance, shuffle them and make them play against each other. Everyone has a 50% chance of winning because we assemble the teams like a coin toss. Better yet, have a server browser and allow players to run and join their own servers and have a built-in function allowing the players to call a vote to shuffle the teams. Quake Live used to have this functionality until that piece of voluntary malware minqlx destroyed that game by giving too much power to the server admins, among these powers include: replacing the team shuffle vote with a team sort vote based on a ranking system that assigns a score to each player up to the complete control of the server administrator, thus allowing server admins to stack the teams in their favor.</p>
