<h1>Ideas for a new game</h1>
<p>There is no use laying out the design of the ideal FPS game when practical considerations dealing with forming the community around such a game remains unknown. After all: who shall run the servers? who will advertise the game? who will investigate and fix bugs? The general answer to all these questions for a game that will last a lifetime will be the community. The game developers should give the community some powers to keep the game running and active. Community ran servers enable the developers to offset some costs of running and maintaining official servers as well as give hope for the game to revive in the future if it ever becomes dormant. Open-source modding or a robust collection of server-side options should be available to allow local parts of the community to try out new balance options which can potentially become part of the official rule set in the future, care must be taken to place a restriction on the range of these options so that the game does not become too fragmented with drastically different rules for each server.</p>
<h1>Server administrators</h1>
<p>The game must be designed well enough and run well enough so that parts of the community will be willing to run their own servers for free. Additional incentives are required to increase the number of volunteer server administrators, this may include: free in-game currency, free exclusive cosmetics, and server-side options that give administrators considerable power over their server. These server side options may include: adjusting the damage of weapons, adjusting the cooldowns of abilities, controlling the map cycle, controlling the time limit, controlling the round limit, adjusting player movement physics, adjusting weapon projectile physics, adjusting player and item respawn times, etc. Enabling scripting plugins may also be desirable.</p>
<p>In-game currency and cosmetics should only be granted to community ran servers that are open to the public. Private or password protected servers will not qualify. The idea is to help the community sustain themselves and be inviting to new players. Games like Reflex FPS died because all the community ran servers were private and the only way to get into a game was to network on obscure IRC and Discord channels. This shall not be the case with this new game.</p>
<p>Server-side options should have sensible limits. Giving server administators too much power will make them into tyrants and drive players away with their ridiculous rulesets or unfair moderation. Quake Live currently has this problem where server administrators have the power to: unfairly stack teams, automatically kick players for having an ELO not within a desired range, automatically pass votes even if most players didn't vote, and <q>slap</q> players in-game causing them to take damage.</p>
<h1>Client-side features</h1>
<p>Players must have a means to provide feedback and report other players through an in-game UI at all times. Reporting players for a specific match should be available even after that match has long ended, this can be done by keeping that player's match history accessible in the game's main menu. There should be almost no limit to how far back this history goes, a player should be able to bring up the stats of a specific match that they played a year ago. Every entry in their match history will have a report button next to every player who was in that match. These entries should also record which server they were playing on by the server ID which should be registered by the server administrator. All public internet servers will be required to upload the stats of each match to a master server. Additional logging information such as the chat log and activity feed may also be uploaded to the master server after every match. Stats and data generated by these games can be made available to 3rd party stat trackers, perhaps for a fee.</p>
<p>While many games do not ban cheaters right away, opting instead to issue <q>ban waves</q> to save time and resources. This game will place the utmost importance in permanently banning cheaters right away through a hardware ban. Such a ban will require hard evidence such as a memory signature, screenshot, or inhuman stats.</p>
<p>Team based game modes will be difficult to manage due to incalculable skill variation and player disconnects. It's tempting to punish players due to rage quitting, but players who crash or lose internet connection are not necessarily at fault. As much as possible, automatic system actions should be in place to account for these common troubles such as automatically moving a player to specatator mode to even the teams when another player disconnects. AFKs and XP farmers should be detectable by the system and those kinds of players should automatically be kicked. For all things that are truly exceptional, the report button should always be available.</p>
<p>Cosmetics have always been used to entice players to play more or spend money. This game shall do the same, but in a way that every player will be able to purchase, with either grind currency or premium currency,  a specific cosmetic directly without having to go through loot boxes or a battle pass. Loot boxes are worse than gambling. Battle passes are a waste of time and money because they are often filled with low quality cosmetics and they are often unfinishable for non-paid players who are not playing 8 hours a day.</p>
<p>No progression system of any kind will be in the game. There will only be stats that you can check on your profile such as time played, average accuracy per weapon, KDA, etc. There may however be certain cosmetics that will only be obtainable by accomplishing great feats such as obtaining a certain number of air rocket kills or maintaining a high overall KDA, so there may be rewards that depend on real skill and not just the number of hours you put into the game.</p>
<p>Players should be able to customize their HUD greatly. There should be a huge set of crosshairs to choose from as well as a large range of sizes, colors, and opacities for each crosshair. Almost every HUD element's visibility should have a toggle option. Mouse sensitivity should be configurable to at least 6 significant figures.</p>
<p>An official manual should be available within the game's main menu, this manual should document every feature of the game including: weapon statistics, player movement speeds, item respawn times, and any other quantifiable numeric constant that influences game calculations. There should be no opaque game feature that a player must learn the hard way, and there should be no hidden pro-strat game knowledge that veteran players use to abuse newer players. If there will be a meta, everyone must know about it from the moment they install the game.</p>
