<h1>Helvian</h1>
<p>Helvian, a new youtube personality within the Paladins community, has recently been hard at work (for no pay) at creating videos that bring to light every bug in the game. He calls this video series <q><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlccf7lD6pc&list=PL9TzdQBafQpSotap91x_Jkfajzt2qyke-">The Hunt</a></q> and it has become a meme within the community with others using that phrase every time they find a bug. These videos have appeared to have helped <s>Hi-rez</s> EvilMojo fix these bugs since Helvian often gives detailed instructions on how to replicate these bugs. His rise to fame kicked off when he uploaded his first big video titled <q><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7O3BPUk9r7s">Why I Hate Paladins</a></q>, it was an hour of him ranting about Paladins but unlike rant videos that you find from other people about this game, it is clear that Helvian knows what he's talking about based on the number of hours he put into the game as well as his general intelligence and certain eloquence and style.</p>
<p>In the making of his <q>The Hunt</q> videos, he often creates custom private games where he and his friends attempt to investigate, replicate, and document the bugs they find. He must really have a lot of time on his hands because there was recently an entire week where he uploaded a new video everyday until he got temporarily banned. Helvian is smart and makes good points, but his ego is beginning to brush against the powers of <s>Hi-rez</s> EvilMojo. A huge game breaking bug that he found.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2C-3LLtcdA&list=PL9TzdQBafQpSotap91x_Jkfajzt2qyke-&index=5&t=7m12s">Episode 4 of The Hunt</a>, Helvian includes a clip of him finding a bug during his live stream. This was known as the <q>ass ass</q> bug because typing those two words in chat will cause any player who see's those words, and who does not have word filter turned off, to crash. After hie published episode 4, many players began using this exploit to crash unknowing victim players. Even Helvian was <a href="https://clips.twitch.tv/DifferentWiseShrewPeanutButterJellyTime">caught purposely using this exploit</a> in one of his later live streams. He was <a href="https://twitter.com/LeHelvian/status/1085929904196198400">banned</a> almost week later with an official statement coming from HiRezAlyssa:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Though we do not normally comment publicly on suspensions, I can confirm that action was taken against your account for repeatedly using a profanity filter to exploit to purposely crash other players on stream.</p>
- Alyssa
</blockquote>
<p>Helvian's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2pQl_nTph8">response video to this ban</a> concedes that he broke the rules and deserves to be banned, but he still cries injustice because he claims other users of this exploit have not been banned; he claims he's been disproportionately punished in comparison to other players who committed the same crime.</p>
<p>The video starts off with him saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I used a glitch twice. Once because I was told how to do the glitch by my chat. At that moment as soon as it was posted in the chat, it was too late: the information was out and even if I didn't do it, my chat would've spread this shit far beyond my stream. In fact they were spreading it before I ever did it. People were already <q>ass ass</q>ing my team out of the game it was already spreading before I typed it.</p>
<p>I must emphasize this, as soon as the repro was typed in my chatroom it was over. By simply having my stream enabled, the glitch was already propagating it's way through the entire community. So you know what, I just decided to fucking test it. I didn't believe it, and it worked. I'm the hunter (bug hunter), I want footage, I knew the risk.</p>
<p>Second time, came about 5 hours later near the end of the stream. A Ying on my team announced she was gonna go AFK because the team was shit. I wasn't fucking having it, so I whipped out my death note and I removed her from the game: one TOS violation for another. Again, I knew the fucking risk, I used it once out of a need for some instant vigilante justice, of course that doesn't excuse me. I got caught, I accepted the ban.</p>
- Helvian
</blockquote>
<p>He then reveals two tweets he made in response to Alyssa who made a public statement about his ban:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>i'm totally fine being banned because i typed 'ass ass' to eject a ying that had no intentions of playing the game, going as far as to confess that thery were going to afk in spawn (which is bannable in itself btw). the rules are the rules, right?</p>
<p>however, i'm not fine with the selective enforcement of rules. there are so many fucking instances of people attempting to 'ass ass' streamers, their party members, EVERYONE involved in their lobbies, and they aren't banned.</p> - Helvian
</blockquote>
<p>He concludes the video with the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, I used a glitch maliciously. No, I did not spread the glitch intentionally. I was powerless to stop it's spread as soon as I was notified during my stream. I attempted to mitigate the spread and the effects immediately. No, I did not use it <i>repeatedly</i> nor <i>many</i> times. I don't want special treatment but I'm currently receiving it. There are hundreds that deserve bans right now and dozens from my own fanbase. The company resorted to dishonest manipulation to smear my name. Stop strawmanning me to allow yourself to stroke your dick to some drama. Stop idolizing me to the point where you think I should be absolved because I am me.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>My opinion of this fiasco</h1>
<p>There is no injustice here. It is true that Helvian could not have anticipated someone leaking the exploit in his live stream chat, his curiosity to try it out to see if it works can also be forgiven. It is, however a mistake on his part to advertise this exploit on his uploaded youtube video <q>The Hunt, episode 4</q>; by doing this, he spread the knowledge of bug/exploit far beyond his local fanbase to the entire Paladins community.</p>
<p>Helvian frequently mentions how his intentions were not malicious and that he tried to tell people how to protect themselves from the exploit by turning off the chat filter. However, the damage is already done and there will always be more players who have chat filter turned on than off since it is a default setting and most of the playerbase do not frequent the forums or the subreddit or Helvian's twitter.</p>
<p>Three things Helvian did:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Test out the exploit to find out it works live on Twitch</li>
	<li>Purposely use the exploit to crash one or two players live on Twitch</li>
	<li>Upload a video to Youtube showing everyone how to use the exploit</li>
</ol>
<p>The third action is the most malicious one if measured only by it's consequences and not taking into account any intentions at all. Unlike other users of this exploit who do it secretly and/or sparingly, Helvian used it in front of his audience and has advertised how anyone can use it. Helvian stands out and he wants attention by making all these videos and raising his voice despite saying he wants to be treated like everyone else. Helvian has caused the most damage by purposely showing everyone how to use this exploit in episode 4 of The Hunt but he fails to mention that in his ban response video.</p> 
<p>It does not matter if he showcased the bug in episode 4 in order to bring awareness to users so they can protect themselves, the intentions are irrelevant when the end result is that significantly more people gained the knowledge and used it for malicious purposes. Numerous reports of people using the exploit to crash both casual and ranked games sprung up after that video was published.</p>
<p>Helvian deserves the ban more than any other user of that exploit for the fact that he multiplied the number of users who now know and use that exploit through Episode 4. Helvian knows that he's popular and people watch his videos and even make video responses to his videos, even though knowledge of this bug would spread to the whole community eventually, he was the great catalyst for this event and he indirectly caused many lost games and the longest unplayable period of Paladins in it's history. Hi-rez/EvilMojo takes fault too for having a terrible buggy game, having a bug where any user can crash any other user by typing something in the chat console is the worst bug I have ever seen in my 20 years of gaming. This type of security flaw reflects the total incompetance of their programmers, this probably falls under the category of sanitizing user input, a computer security guideline that any Computer Science student would learn about in their first year.</p>
<h1>The execution of the Law</h1>
<p>Helvian's understanding of law and morality when placed in practice is lacking, for he believes that intentions should be considered in a punishment and that the execution of the law should not make exceptions and every punishment should be equal for every offender. Perhaps these are textbook principles that he learned in highschool or that these are concepts that he intrinsically believes based on his British origin.</p>
<p>When someone breaks the law, whoever enforces that law can choose when and who to punish based on prudence and circumstance. This is because laws are not perfect in every scenario. For example, speeding on the highway is illegal but an officer may let the offender off the hook if the offender is on his way to the hospital and his wife is in the backseat and she's about to give birth. It would be ridiculous if an onlooking bystander shouted <q>That's not fair! I got a speeding ticket a week ago and you're not going to give these people a ticket? I'm being unequally treated by our government! The system is corrupt!</q>.</p>
<p>In Helvian's case, not only does he break a rule but he does it without remorse, breaks it a couple more times, and shows everyone else how to do it. And he has the audacity to complain that he's being unfairly targetted for his crime. He clearly was asking for it and he wants the attention.</p>
<p>This scenario is very similar to copyright enforcement. Digital piracy is illegal, those who enforce it are not going to waste their time going after each individual who downloads illegally, instead they will go after those who upload and host pirated software illegally because the latter has a greater effect in doing more damage than the former. Helvian needs to stop thinking in black and white and he needs to understand that enforcing the law does not mean following a set of instructions literally in every situation for every person. Enforcing the law also does not necessarily mean a policy of zero-tolerance (where no exceptions are made). Finally enforcing the law does not mean equal punishment for every crime because there are different ways and degrees to which one can break a rule and thus more or less punishment is deserved (for example: first degree murder and second degree murder).</p>
