<h1>The machiavellianism behind Hi-Rez</h1>
<p>There are so many problems with Paladins, yet there are so many players who are loyal and devoted enough to not only keep playing while complaining endlessly of how bad the game is, but some of them utilize a lot of their time and multimedia skills to create very informative and entertaining videos about how bad the game is for free. People either love Paladins or they love to hate Paladins. Even I fall under this truth. I however have at least had the will to keep the game uninstalled for a month now and my life is feeling better everyday.</p>
<p>It is amazing how much work people put into making this game better and how political people get in campaigning for better changes, all while most of them don't even get paid by Hi-Rez to do all this. Obviously anyone who officially works for Hi-Rez gets paid, but all of the twitch streamers and forum moderators and youtube video creators and deviantart artists and instagram cosplayers who create and entertain in the name of Paladins all operate voluntarily and on donations. The illusion that these special people have a voice, let alone a voice for the others who play the game, and that they make up the pillar of some community that they think is authentic and grassroots against the community of Overwatch: is that what gives them hope and energy? Is it not their fame that gives them their illusion of power while they are ultimately pawns for whoever has the real power at Hi-Rez?</p>
<p>Cue the Assembly of Champions to destroy this hope. This is Hi-Rez's genius way of putting these self-appointed spokesmen in their place, to let them know that they are not important and anything they say to critique the game will only backfire on their reputation. For Hi-Rez is now saying <q>we have the power to choose who represents the community</q> in the background while saying in the foreground <q>we are giving the community a chance to vote for their own representatives instead of putting up with the tribal and illegitimate 3rd party content creators.</q> If only Hi-Rez's dictatorship was a benevolent one, then people would be happy with this.</p>
