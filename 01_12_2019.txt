<h1>Knowing the Meta vs Having luck</h1>
<p>Every multiplayer game has a meta. What is meta? It's a terminology in gaming that stands for <i>Most Effective Tactic Available</i>, it's also short for metagame: which is about obtaining knowledge about the best strategies and tactics for a particular game. The <i>meta of a game</i> refers to the best known strategy for winning that game, a strategy that is typically so effective that any other strategy used will fail if it is used in opposition to the meta strategy.</p>
<p>Is is my opinion that a balanced game will not have a meta. This is not to say that every possible strategy is equally viable, unless one redefines and restricts the set of legitimate strategies, but that the number of strategies that are equal to other strategies in advantages and tradeoffs is large enough to make every match unpredictable from beginning to end, but especially from the beginning.</p>
<p>A game with an unhealthy meta favors only those players who have the knowledge of that meta, throughout the match as long as the player makes the correct choices to follow the meta all non-knowers stand no chance. A game with this type of meta becomes a mirror game, a game of doing the same thing as your opponent until someone makes a mistake, there's no diversity in playstyle and thus no way for other types of skills to develop and blossom forth.</p>
<p>Example of Paladins meta: As of today, and for over a year now, the Paladins meta is buy cauterize from the item shop. The item shop in Paladins is a collection of items that you may buy during the match, these items grant various benefits and last until the match is over, these items are bought with credits which are mainly obtained for getting kills and securing the objective during the match. Many new players are unaware of the existence of the item shop. For those who are, many of them are unaware of the meta item(s): the most important being cauterize, which is an item that reduces healing on targets that you shoot by up to 90%. Not having your entire team buy cauterize and upgrade it to it's maximum level means you will lose. Every veteran player rushes buying cauterize to it's maximum level before buying any other items in the majority of their games. Even if the enemy team does not have a healer, you still want to rush cauterize because every champion in the game has the ability to heal themselves through their loadout or through healing-based items. What separates the top 20% of players from the rest is this very simple knowledge that I just explained, only after it is determined that both players/teams are on equal footing in terms of cauterize can one begin to take skill and any other factor into consideration on who will win.</p>
<p>This is still not as bad as it sounds, all one has to do is learn the meta and that becomes their initiation into the game as a valid player who will not weigh down the rest of the team due to uneducated non-meta choices. What could be worse than a game with a strict meta? A meta whose utilization is not based on making choices, but on having pure luck.</p>
<p>Realm Royale, a game that falls under the battle royale genre and is developed by the same company that make Paladins, has: not a choice-based meta but a luck-based meta. The one weapon in the game that is the best, that overpowers every other weapon, that guarantees victory in the hands of the at least semi-competant player is the Venom Pistol. Obtaining this weapon is the meta, but this weapon cannot be crafted or obtained in any determinate way, it can only be obtained from a loot chest or loot goblin: both of which drop random items. Whoever is lucky enough to get this item dropped to them, especially the legendary version of the venom pistol, hits the jackpot: they win. I have not played a lot of Fortnite recently and I've never played PUBG, but I am sure the rest of the battle royale games have this type of luck-based overpowered weapon drops. These type of luck based games should organize all of their esports tournaments in Los Vegas with the rest of the gamblers.</p>
<p>I do not like powerups or power weapons that give a single player such an overpowering advantage to the rest of the players. I barely tolerate them in games like Quake: where they spawn in the same spot at a constant rate of time so that the meta becomes being able to time the powerup spawn and contest for it successfully: that at least takes some skill but usually it comes down to only 2 players contesting for it because every other player in the match is not intelligent enough to time it. But to make a power item's obtainment completely luck-based is an impulsive game design feature to grant the feeling of power to players who have not even put in as much time and effort as the veteran players and the addicts.</p>
<p>Our current knowledge of luck is shut off to any development because we like to think it doesn't exist, that luck is just biased perception and it's unscientific. We laugh at those who have good luck charms and read horoscopes and practice other spiritual or cosmic rituals. We laugh because the feeling of comfort and security at the thought that our universe is completely ordered and knowable is proven to us by it's power to sustain and destroy life. Is it real laughter or is it a nervous fearful laughter because we must be on it's side to not only survive but to keep our reputation in the midst of it's followers?</p>
<p>By introducing more luck into the game, one potentially introduces mysterious outside forces to control the flow of the game. Who is to say that luck treats everyone equally? Who is to say that luck does not favor one race of people over another? Shall we take that chance or shall we give everyone equal opportunity to get better at a game by making it dependent on skill and practice? As a game developer you relinquish all sovereignty to game balance when you concede the powers of determining victory to random and chaotic processes, you no longer have a vision or semblance of what the best players will be and you do not cultivate any type of skill in these potential players, it not only reflects lack of vision but laziness to balance a game. Who will continue playing except fools?</p>
