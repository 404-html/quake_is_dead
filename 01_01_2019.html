				<blockquote>
					<p>Falseness with a good conscience; the delight in simulation exploding as a power that pushes aside one's so-called <q>character,</q> flooding it and at times extinguishing it; the inner craving for a role and mask, for <i>appearance</i>; an excess of the capacity for all kinds of adaptions that can no longer be satisfied in the service of the most immediate and narrowest utility - all of this is perhaps not only peculiar to the actor?</p>
					<p>Such an intinct will have developed most easily in families of the lower classes who had to survive under changing pressures and coercions, in deep dependency, who had to cut their coat according to the cloth, always adapting themselves again to new circumstances, who always had to change their mien and posture, until they learned gradually to turn their coat with every wind and thus virtually to <i>become</i> a coat - and masters of the incorporated and inveterate art of eternally playing hide-and-seek, which in the case of animals is called mimicry - until eventually this capacity, accumulated from generation to generation, becomes domineering, unreasonable, intractable, an intinct that learns to lord it over other intincts, and generates the actor, the <q>artist</q>.</p>

			<p>Does it not all make sense now why every shooter, including Quake, now feels the urge and instinct to incorporate more role-playing elements into their genre? Either to fulfill this historical instinct for survival or because people who now exist as empty shells in this now empty meaningless world need ways to lose themselves in countless characters of role-play and fantasy? Why do hero shooters never stop making new heroes? Nobody is strong enough to keep one identity for too long, lest the pressure to maintain that identity and the possibility of failing to live up to it's ideal close in. To escape all scrutinity and responsibility while at the same time not wanting to be alone is one of the many paradoxes of the human condition.</p>
			<p>But what if we could change this condition? Is our conscious will too dangerous to trust when it comes to deciding what instincts shall be developed or repressed? Instead of giving in to the trends of the present or the instincts from our past can we not make a game that elevates the condition of it's players, through discipline if necessary and coated with milk and chocolate to intice them at first until their appetites develop  for bolder flavors and nutrients, rather than adapt itself to every one of their petty pleasures and comforts without thinking of how that would damage and keep them underdeveloped? Not a single line of code can be written until the direction and vision of the new player base is realized. How do we keep a social activity not only sterile from the mutations and diseases, both mental and physical, born from overcrowding and oversocialization but also engineer it into a bootcamp of strength and sportsmanship?</p>
